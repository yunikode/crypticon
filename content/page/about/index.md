## Who am I

I am a nonbinary person who is going by the name of Manouk, Fiona or Fio. I am a Jane-of-all-trades and actually a master-of-some. If it has a programmable interface I will try my best to get access, be it by manual or forceful hacking my way into it.

## What did I do so far

My career in computers started in the late 1980s with fixing them and led to self-taught programming in the early 1990s. Early highlights were helping a project with digitizing buildings for a scientific experiment concerning on how someone orients themselve in a city that maybe has been altered without informing the subject.  

## My (in)formal education

I am a certified system administrator and software developer by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Germany.
